I’m currently finishing my Computer Information Systems degree out in Canada. I write code, break (then fix) everything, and ship stuff that’s built to be functional *and* intentional.  
I’m into systems that respect users, tools that stay out of the way, and platforms that don't need a ToS as long as a novel.
